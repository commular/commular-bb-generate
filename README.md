A [commular](https://github.com/tcorral/commular) module to Generate Backbase Components.

### Generate

Scaffold new widgets, containers and other Backbase CXP components.

The tool generates the starting template for the chosen item in the directory where you run the command.

```
[cli_name] generate widget
```

```
[cli_name] generate container
```

```
[cli_name] generate project
```

```
[cli_name] generate template
```

Read more about generate API [here](/docs/generate.md).


To get more information I recommend to read the use cases in tests.

## Tests

```bash
npm install
npm test
```
